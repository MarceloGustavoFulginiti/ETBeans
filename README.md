# ETBeans
Embedded Multi Tool Chains for NetBeans IDE

This project is basically a well structured, easy and documented procedures (and some plug-in) to incorporate in a NetBeans environment, diverse tool chains for target platforms of microcontrollers and host machines x86/Linux/Windows. The goal is to easily mantain and ampliate an uniform development environment for implementing Embedded Systems.

The "NetBeans" is an multiplatform-multilanguage Open Source IDE, mantained by ORACLE.

The tools chains are GCC/GNU, appropiate to each porting according to the platform's microprocessor core.
